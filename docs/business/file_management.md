# File coordinator worker

The file coordinator worker is a separate program from the server, that is responsible for setting completed status for the file. It is accessible to other services via following API:
```json
routing-key: checking/file
body:
{
    "file_id": "1"
}
``` 

On message it should:

#### AC 1

Find the file by given id  

#### AC 1.1

check whether its status is 'D'?  
- yes - set its status to 'C'  
- no - continue  

#### AC 1.2

Check whether its status is 'C'?  
- yes - continue  
- no - finish message processing  

#### AC 2

Fetch all <b>tags</b> for current file. 

There are no tags?
- yes - finish message processing  
- no - continue  

#### AC 2.1

There is only one tag?  
- yes - go to AC 2.1.1  
- no - go to AC 2.2.1  

#### AC 2.1.1

Is tag status 'C'?  
- yes - continue  
- no - finish message processing  

#### AC 2.1.2

Request tag parsing via the /up-vibe/v1/files/{fileId}/parse-tags API and finish message processing  

#### AC 2.2.1

Are all tag statuses either 'C' or 'E'?  
- yes - continue  
- no - finish message processing  

#### AC 3

Fetch all records (<b>mappings</b> later) from [tag_mappings](../database/tags/tag_mappings.md) where:  
file_id = request.file_id  
fixed = FALSE  

#### AC 4

For each record in <b>mappings</b> perform AC 5

#### AC 5

Get <b>pirorities</b> from the [tag_mapping_priorities](../database/tags/tag_mapping_priorities.md) table where:  
user_id = <b>mapping</b>.user_id  

#### AC 5.1

Form tag_mapping using <b>tags</b> and <b>pirorities</b>, set fixed to TRUE and update it in the database.

#### AC 5.2

Get <b>user_file</b> record from [user_files](../database/files/user_files.md) table where:  
user_id = <b>mapping</b>.user_id  
file_id = request.file_id  

#### AC 5.3

Update the [file_synchronization](../database/files/file_synchronization.md) table with:  
is_synchronized = FALSE  
server_ts = current timestamp    
where:  
user_file_id = <b>user_file</b>.id  

#### AC 5.4

Update the file status to done  

# Plugins  

The server relies on plugins to perform such actions as file downloading, parsing, etc. The current version requires the following plugins:
- Downloader  
This plugin is responsible for the file.source_url parsing and validation and communication with downloading workers. For example, the amqp message produced by this plugin should look like the following:
```json
routing-key: downloading/file-source-name
body:
{
    "file_id": 1,
    "url": "some/url",
    "uuid": "uuid",
}
```
This plugin should also provide an API for getting source id by the url(getSource method), and an API for url normalization(normalizeUrl).
- Parser  
This plugin is responsible for the communication with parsing workers. For example, the amqp message produced by this plugin should look like one of the following:
```json
routing-key: parsing/native/file-source-name
body:
{
    "file_id": 1,
    "url": "some/url"
}
```
```json
routing-key: parsing/source-name
body:
{
    "tag_id": 1
}
```

- File tagger    
This plugin is responsible for the file preparation before sending it to the user. It is required for this plugin to return the path to the prepared file immediately, and it should guarantee that file will remain intact for some time after its creation.  

# Downloading  

The client can request the server to download a file via POST /up-vibe/v1/files request. The client has to pass a request with the following JSON structure in the body:
```json
{
    "url": "some/url"
}
```

The server should:

user_file_id = <b>user_file</b>.id  

# Tag parsing  

The client can request the server to create and parse tags via POST /up-vibe/v1/files/{fileId}/tags request. The client has to pass a request with the related file id as a url parameter.

The server should:

#### AC 1

The server should:

#### AC 1

Try to find a record in the [tags](../database/tags/tags.md) table where:  
file_id = request.url.file_id  
user_id = request.user.id   

Does the record exist?  
- yes - continue  
- no - abort the operation and send the "No such tag" message

#### AC 2

#### AC 1

Set tag_mapping fixed to TRUE together with rest of the fields.

#### AC 2

Get <b>user_file</b> records from [user_files](../database/files/user_files.md) table where:

is_synchronized = FALSE  
server_ts = current timestamp  
where:  
user_file_id = <b>user_file</b>.id  

## Tag mapping priorities

As all sources provide tags of different quality, it is natural to choose tags from the finest sources first, then from less formidable ones, and so on. Tag mapping priorities are a simple way to automate this.  

Default priority for each user is configurable, using following format:  
```json
{
  "title": [
    0
  ],
  "artist": [
    0
  ],
  "album": [
    0
  ],
  "year": [
    0
  ],
  "trackNumber": [
    0
  ],
  "picture": [
    0
  ]
}
```  
Each item in the arrays is a source id. Its priority is defined by the position in the array; for example, the item on index 0 has the highest priority, and so on.

# File receiving  

The client can request the tagged file from the server using GET /up-vibe/v1/files/{fileId}/download request. The client has to pass a request with the related file id as a url parameter.

file_id = request.url.file_id  

Does the record exist?  
- yes - go to AC 2  
- no - abort the operation and send the "File does not exist" (errorCode 1) error response to the user  

#### AC 2

Check the status of the found file.

If a status is:
- "ะก" - go to AC 3
- "E" - abort the operation and send the "File preparation failed" (errorCode 2) error response to the user   
- otherwise - abort the operation and send the "File is not ready yet" (errorCode 3) error response to the user

#### AC 3
Try to find a record in the [tag_mappings](../database/tags/tag_mappings.md) table by the following filter:  
file_id = request.url.file_id
user_id = request.user.id   

Does the record exist?  
- yes - go to AC 4  
- no - abort the operation and send the "Tag mapping does not exist" (errorCode 4) error response to the user  

#### AC 4

Find all required tag records in the [tags](../database/tags/tags.md) table by the following filter:  
file_id = request.url.file_id  
source = [all sources that required by the mapping]

#### AC 5

Create a tag object by combining all the tag data from the previous step and tag file. 
Value mapping for the request:  
tag = [created_tag]
file = [file.uuid]  

Does the plugin report an error?  
- yes - abort the operation and send the error response to the user (errorCode -1)  
- no - send a file to the user

# File confirmation  

The client must confirm file downloading or deletion using POST /up-vibe/v1/files/{fileId}/confirm request

The server should:

Any records found?
- yes - finalize processing
- no - go to AC 6

#### AC 6

Find records in the [user_files](../database/files/user_files.md) table where:  
file_id = request.url.file_id
